## THE NEPHRON.

This is the basic functional unit of the kidney.
Each kidney contains about 5 million nephrons.
Parts of the nephron.

1.  Afferent arteriole- brings blood to the nephron from the renal artery.
2.  Efferent arteriole - takes blood away from the nephron to the renal vein.
3.  Bowman's capsule- cavity which encloses the glomerulus.

4.  Glomerulus (Plural- glomeruli) - a network of capillaries enclosed by Bowmanâ€™s capsule.
5.  Proximal convoluted tubule- it is coiled and extends into Loop of Henle.
6.  Loop of Henle- U- shaped part of the nephron.
7.  Distal convoluted tubule- it is coiled and leads into a collecting duct/ tubule
8.  Collecting duct- it receives urine from several nephrons and directs it to the pelvis and ureter.
