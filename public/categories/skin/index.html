  <h1 id="skin">Skin</h1>
<p>The skin is used to excrete urea, excess water, salts, ammonia.
Functions of the skin.
Protection of the underlying tissues from entry of microorganisms, physical damage and ultra violet rays from the sun.
Regulation of body temperature/thermoregulation.
Excretion.
Reception of stimuli of heat, cold, pain, touch and pressure. 5.
Synthesis of vitamin D.
Storage of fats.</p>
<h2 id="adaptation-to-function-of-different-parts-of-the-skin">ADAPTATION TO FUNCTION OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SKIN</h2>
<p>The skin consists of two main layers: epidermis and dermis.</p>
<p>A. The epidermis- it consists of 3 layers: cornified layer, granular layer and malpighian layer.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cornified layer- it is the outermost layer of the skin made up of dead cells that are covered with flexible substance called keratin that;
a) Provides protection against mechanical/ physical damage.
b) Provides protection against entry of pathogens.
c) Reduces loss of water by evaporation.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The cells of cornified layer are continuously lost through friction and are replaced by cells from granular layer.</li>
<li>The thickness of cornified layer varies in the body e.g. it is thickest in areas of high friction like palms of hands and soles of feet but thinnest on lips and eyeballs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Granular layer this is a middle layer consisting of living cells that give rise to the cornified layer.</p>
<p>Malpighian layer- this is the innermost layer consisting of actively dividing cells that give rise to the new epidermis.</p>
<p>The cells also have a pigment called melanin that gives the skin its colour and protects it against harmful effects of ultra violet (UV) rays from the sun.</p>
<p>B. The dermis- it consists of:</p>
<p>Sweat/ sudorific glands- consists of secretory cells secrete more sweat from surrounding blood vessels and tissues (consisting of excretory wastes e.g. excess water, traces of urea, lactic acid, ammonia and excess mineral salts) when it is hot.
 Sweat is brought/ flows to the skin surface through sweat duct. Water in sweat evaporates/sweat evaporates carrying with it latent heat of vaporization thus cooling the body/ reducing body temperature.
 And it also helps in excretion of lactic acid, traces of urea, excess water, ammonia and excess mineral salts and regulation of salt and water balance (osmoregulation).
 In cold weather, little or no sweat is produced thus heat is conserved.</p>
<p>Blood vessels/arterioles Blood vessels contain blood that supplies nutrients and oxygen to skin tissues and remove waste products and carbon (IV) oxide.</p>
<ul>
<li>When it is hot/ when temperature rises above optimum the arterioles dilate (vasodilate), more blood flows near the skin surface hence more heat is lost through conduction and convection.</li>
<li>When it is cold/ temperature fall below normal, the arterioles constrict (vasoconstrict), less blood flows near the skin surface hence less heat is lost/ heat conserved/ insulates the body against heat loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hairs and erector pili muscle.-Hairs grow in hair follicles. Erector pili muscle attaches the hair follicle to the epidermis. Hair follicle is supplied with sensory nerves to increase sensitivity of the skin and blood vessels that supply nutrients and remove waste products.
They are also used in thermoregulation. When it is cold/ when temperature drops below normal, erector pili muscles contract, causing the hairs to stand erect. Hairs trap air which is a poor conductor of heat, preventing heat loss/ conserving heat.
When it is hot/ when temperature rises above normal, erector pili muscles relax, hairs lie flat on the skin surface, trapping less air hence more heat is lost.</p>
<p>Sebaceous glands- They are attached and open into the hair follicle.
They secrete sebum which keeps the hair and epidermis flexible/ supple/soft and waterproof. Sebum also contains</p>
<p>Nerve endings of nerve cells- they detect stimuli of pain, pressure and temperatures of the external environment to enable organism to respond to changes in the environment.
Subcutaneous layer/adipose tissue.- this is a layer of fat cells beneath the dermis.
It binds the skin to the muscles and other organs deep in the body.
It also stores fats and acts as an insulator against heat loss/ conserves heat.
It also contains a special type of cells that manufactures vitamin D when exposed to the sun.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-the-skin-adapted-to-protection">How is the skin adapted to protection?</h2>
<p>The cornified layer is made of dead cells; which protects the body against physical/mechanical injury/ damage; prevents entry of pathogens and poisonous chemicals;
 The sebaceous gland produces an oily secretion /sebum; that protects the skin against invasion by micro-organisms (acts as antiseptic).
 Malpighian layer contains melanin; which protects the body against harmful ultra-violet rays.</p>
<h2 id="role-of-skin-in-excretion-and-homeostasis">ROLE OF SKIN IN EXCRETION AND HOMEOSTASIS.</h2>
<p><strong>Role of the skin in excretion.</strong></p>
<p>Sweat glands secrete sweat containing excess water, mineral salts, ammonia, traces of urea, lactic acid. Sweat flows through the sweat duct to the skin surface and the wastes are lost.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptations/ role of the skin in homeostasis.</strong></p>
<p>a) Osmoregulation.
The skin has sweat glands that secrete sweat containing excess water and mineral salts/ ions and other wastes e.g. urea hence maintaining water and ions balance.
The water and mineral lost in the sweat contributes to osmotic changes of the body cells and fluids.
On a hot day, the body loses a lot of water and some mineral salts, resulting in the sensation of thirst being felt due to tissue dehydration.
The osmotic balance is however restored by drinking large volumes of water and intake of mineral salts in the diet.</p>
<p>b) Thermoregulation.
It has blood arterioles/ vessels that vasodilate (vasodilation) when it is hot/ when the body temperature rises above normal, the hypothalamus is stimulated which sends impulse to the skin causing more blood flows near the skin surface hence more heat is lost.
When it is cold/ when the body temperature falls below normal, the arterioles constrict/ vasoconstrict (vasoconstriction), less blood flows near the skin surface hence less heat is lost/ heat is conserved.
It has erector pili muscles which contract when it is cold/ when the body temperature falls below normal.
This causes hairs to stand erect trapping more air. Air which is a poor conductor of heat insulates the body against heat loss/ prevents heat loss.</p>
<p>When the temperature is raised above the normal/when it is hot, erector pili muscles relax, hair lies flat on the skin surface, less air is trapped and more heat is lost.
It has sweat glands which secrete more sweat when the temperature is raised above the normal/when it is hot.
Water in sweat evaporates/sweat evaporates, taking up heat from the body hence the body is cooled/temperature lowered.
When it is cold/ when temperature drops below normal sweat glands are less stimulated/there is less sweating leading to less vaporization of water/less heat loss.</p>
<h2 id="study-question">Study question</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>State one homeostatic role of the human skin.
 Thermoregulation, osmoregulation, regulation of salts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name three structures of the skin essential for its homeostatic function.
Sweat glands.
Hair.
Erector pili muscle.
Blood vessels/ arterioles..
Nerve endings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain why the amount of sweat increases with increase in temperature.
This is because of increase in latent heat of vaporization hence causing evaporation/ vaporization of sweat to cool the body.</p>
